A high proportion of COVID-19 cases are not reported with 
demographic information such as race/ethnicity. Populations with
reduced access to quality healthcare and testing resources are 
more likely to experience Covid-19 morbidity and mortality,
and thus is it not appropriate to omit or distribute
missing case data randomly. We adapt methods described in 
Trangucci et al. 2023 to infer the distribution of missing cases
by race/ethnicity. Here, we solely consider the cases that 
were reported without race/ethnicity and do not consider 
infections that were not reported.
