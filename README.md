# COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub Research - Resources

The repository contains auxiliary data and code relevant to the modeling
effort for the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub Research rounds


## Disparities Rounds 

The repository contains a [disparities](./disparities/) folder regrouping
all the auxiliary code and data associated with the disparities rounds.

The folder contains multiple sub-folders:

- [case_imputation](./disparities/case_imputation/): imputed case time 
  series by race/ethnicity 
- [vaccination](./disparities/vaccination/): vaccination time series by age 
  and race/ethnicity 
- [serology](./disparities/serology/): monthly infection-based and combined 
  vaccination/infection seroprevalence time series 
- [population_data](./disparities/population_data/): state-level population age 
  structure by age and race/ethnicity
- [hospitalization_data](./disparities/hospitalization_data/): hospitalization 
  time series by race/ethnicity 
- [contact_matrix](./disparities/contact_matrix/): synthetic contact matrices by 
  race/ethnicity in the community, household, workplace, school, and combined 
  setting in the pre-pandemic and pandemic period
- [mobility](./disparities/mobility): weekly mobility data at the census tract 
  level
